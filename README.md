This project presents a "Circular Economy" simulator for sustainable rice cultivation, addressing the dual environmental challenges of methane emissions from flooded fields and pollution from open husk burning. Built with Python and Streamlit, this interactive web application models an integrated system where Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) reduces emissions while a gasifier converts waste husks into renewable electricity and biochar. The simulation functions by taking user-defined inputs—such as farm size, yield, and technology efficiency—and processing them through four governing mathematical models to generate real-time data on energy output, carbon mitigation, and economic payback, effectively demonstrating the profitability and scalability of sustainable agricultural practices.
